# Monte-Carlo
This project aims to forecast the potential price range of the NIFTY 50 index over the next 30 trading days using a Monte Carlo simulation model based on historical market behavior.

The model uses:

One year of historical data from the NIFTY 50 index.

Calculated daily returns, mean (μ), and standard deviation (σ) from past data.

A Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) framework to simulate future price paths.

10,000 simulations to capture a wide range of potential market movements.

The output includes:

A graphical visualization of all simulated future paths.

A statistical summary showing the expected minimum, maximum, average, and standard deviation of the NIFTY 50 price 30 days into the future.

This model helps in understanding the probable risk and return over a short-term horizon and can assist traders, analysts, and investors in decision-making under uncertainty.
